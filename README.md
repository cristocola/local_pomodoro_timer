🍅 Local Pomodoro Timer
A fully offline Pomodoro productivity tracker that runs entirely on your machine. No internet, no cloud—just local work with a beautiful UI, local logging via SQLite, and easy management via a system tray icon.

Overview
This project provides a simple, visually appealing Pomodoro timer with the following features:

Interactive Timer: Adjust Pomodoro, break, and alarm durations.

Animated UI: Smooth animations, motivational quotes, and a modern design.

Local Logging: Completed pomodoros are recorded into a local SQLite database.

Dual Interface:

index.html: Main timer interface.

index2.html: Detailed log history showing daily pomodoro counts.

Backend Services:

A static file server (port 8000) for serving the web files.

A Flask API server (port 5000) for logging operations.

System Tray Integration: Control the app from the system tray.

One-Click Launch: A VBScript (start_pomodoro.wsf) that starts the server and opens your browser.

How It Works
Frontend
index.html:
The main user interface for the timer. Set your desired durations, start/pause the timer, and see motivational quotes. It uses JavaScript (via fetch calls) to communicate with the backend for logging completed pomodoros.

index2.html:
Displays a detailed log history with daily pomodoro counts.

Backend (server.py)
Static File Server (Port 8000):
Uses a custom handler to securely serve your HTML, CSS, and media files, preventing directory listing.

Flask API Server (Port 5000):
Provides these endpoints:

POST /log – Save a new log entry.

GET /logs – Retrieve all log entries.

POST /delete-last-log – Delete the most recent log entry.

System Tray Integration:
Utilizes pystray and Pillow to display a tray icon, allowing you to exit the application gracefully.

Launcher (start_pomodoro.wsf)
Checks if the server is running.

Starts server.py if needed.

Opens your default web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x must be installed.

Git is installed and configured.

Steps to Set Up
Clone the Repository (if you haven't already):

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/cristocola/local_pomodoro_timer.git
cd local_pomodoro_timer
(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

Windows:

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:

Create a file named requirements.txt with the following content:

ini
Copy
Flask==2.2.2
pystray==0.17.3
Pillow==9.4.0
Then run:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the Application:

Double-click start_pomodoro.wsf
OR

Run in the terminal:

bash
Copy
python server.py
Then, open your browser at:

arduino
Copy
http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html
Usage
Start a Pomodoro Session:
Set your desired durations in the UI and click the appropriate buttons to start, pause, reset, or finish your pomodoro.

View Logs:
Click the "View Log History" link in the UI to open index2.html and see your daily progress.

Exit the Application:
Use the system tray icon to exit the application gracefully.

Future Enhancements
CSV export of logs.

Graphical statistics of daily/weekly progress.

Packaging as a desktop executable.

Theme toggle (dark/light mode).

Desktop notifications for session events.

Privacy
All data is stored locally in pomodoro_logs.db.

The app runs entirely on 127.0.0.1 with no external data transmission.
